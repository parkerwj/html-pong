# Overview

As a software engineer, I wanted to create a game that would challenge me and help further my learning. The game I created is called Super Mario Bounce. It is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle and tries to bounce a ball past their opponent to score points. The game ends when one player scores ten points.

To play the game, the players use the arrow keys (or W and S keys for player 1) to move their paddles up and down. The ball bounces off the top and bottom of the screen and off the paddles. If the ball gets past a player's paddle and goes off the screen, the other player scores a point. The game is won by the player who reaches ten points first.

My purpose in writing this software was to challenge myself and improve my skills as a software engineer. I wanted to create a game that was fun to play and would teach me new things about programming.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write the code for this game. Visual Studio Code is a free, open-source code editor that is lightweight and easy to use. It helped me manage my code and test the game in real-time. I also used the following tools and libraries:

* JavaScript - The programming language used to create the game logic
* HTML5 Canvas - A powerful tool used to create graphics and animations in web browsers
* Web Audio API - Used to play background music and sound effects
* CSS - Used for styling the game page and adding aesthetics to the game

I found that integrating these tools and libraries was a fun and challenging task, as I had to experiment with different approaches to get the game working smoothly. In the end, I learned a lot about game development and JavaScript programming that I can apply to future projects.

# Future Work

* Add different levels with different ball speeds and paddle sizes
* Add power-ups that can affect the game, such as making the ball faster or bigger
* Improve the AI for one-player mode
* Make the game mobile-friendly
